                            Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Publications, and by the early 1950s, had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel branding began 1961, the year that the company launched The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others.

                        <h3>OUR VALUES</h3>
                        <h2>It's not Just <span>what</span> we do, it's 
                            <span>how</span> we go all in
                        </h2>
                        <p> <b>Be Accountable – even when no-one is looking</b> <br/>
                            We take ownership for the quality of our individual work but also take pride in what we deliver as a team; our focus is on a successful outcome for all. When things don’t go as planned we proactively use it as an opportunity to share and learn.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Thrive Together – greatness comes from unlocking each other’s potential</b><br/>
                            We believe that seeking and giving feedback are essential for us to learn; we want to inspire each other to achieve great things. As each individual grows, so does the whole organization.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b> Advance Confidently – we find opportunity and act on it</b><br/>
                            We have the courage and curiosity to challenge the status quo, innovate and take calculated risks. Finding new ways to move forward translates into growth for our products, our company, and ourselves.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Collaborate Openly – our whole is greater than the sum of our parts</b><br/>
                            We value team over individual; how we get things done is as important as what we achieve. Our success is driven by our ability to build relationships, break silos and connect across teams, functions and geographies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Engage Fearlessly – we speak up and listen</b><br/>
                            We bring passion and energy to work, knowing that active participation is essential to create better outcomes. We value those who speak thoughtfully, encourage and respect diversity of opinion and listen carefully with an open mind.
